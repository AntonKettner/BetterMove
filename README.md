# Better Move Extension

The Better Move extension enhances your coding experience by allowing you to seamlessly rearrange function arguments in your code. By remapping key combinations, it enables efficient argument shuffling within code blocks. This extension is particularly useful for developers working with Python, C, and JavaScript files.

## Features

- Remap Key Combinations: Control the movement of function arguments with ease using `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + ArrowLeft/ArrowRight`.
- Argument Swapping: Move an argument, within parentheses, brackets, or braces, forward or backward in the argument list, effectively swapping it with adjacent arguments.
- Cursor Tracking: The cursor accompanies the moving argument, allowing for quick successive moves.
- Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for scenarios where the cursor is outside a function or when attempting to move an argument beyond function boundaries.

## Usage

Key combinations:
- `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + ArrowLeft` - Moves the selected argument to the left.
- `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + ArrowRight` - Moves the selected argument to the right.

The cursor will stay with the argument, allowing for continuous adjustment.

## Compatibility

- The extension has been tested on Windows 10 and Kubuntu

## Installation & Requirements

- Platform: Windows, Linux
- Requirements: No specific requirements are known. Please report any unforeseen issues.

## Configuration

- Keybindings: You can customize the `MoveLeft` and `MoveRight` commands through the extension settings.
- Code Analysis Depth: Set the depth for code analysis to define how many lines above and below the cursor are considered (Default is 10 lines).

## Feedback and Support

This is my first JavaScript project, and I welcome any feedback. Please report bugs or share your suggestions, and I will address them promptly.
